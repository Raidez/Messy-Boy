J'ai décidé de participer à une Game Jam, j'ai donc choisi arbitrairement la [Weekly Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-120), le thème annoncé est "What a Mess" (= Quel Bordel)

I got the idea of a Paper Mario like when each action doing mess (attack, item, random event), that filling a bar when is full, it's use a super special attack ...
I will call it "Messy Boy", it's the story of a boy who has a diogenes syndrome, a very bad guy stole his "things" and he want to get back !
